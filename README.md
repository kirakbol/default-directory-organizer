# default-directory-organizer
A python script that takes an argument about a path and turns the files (not the folders), turns the files into that path into hidden files and writes activity log for the actions it makes so the user knows what has been changed in that path

When running the program execute it with '/<the path you want the program to organize>/' at the end
